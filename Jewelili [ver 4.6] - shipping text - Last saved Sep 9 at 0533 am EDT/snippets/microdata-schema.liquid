        3. Place tiny dishes around the house, where you can place the ring for safekeeping when you remove it.
        4. To clean the ring, you can place it in a glass of vodka for an hour and then wipe off the excess liquid gently with a soft, lint-free cloth. Alternatively, place the ring in a bowl of liquid detergent and lukewarm water for 30 minutes and then wipe off gently with a soft, lint-free cloth.
        5. Don’t place it with other jewelry in a jewelry box, since rubbing against other metals or sharp edges could damage the body.
