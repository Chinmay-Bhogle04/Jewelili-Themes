        <p>
          For women, engagement rings have a very special place in affirming their connection with their soulmate. Who doesn’t love being celebrated with a precious gemstone or a diamond encrusted on a wedding ring that shouts, “Yes, I want to be with you for the rest of my life.” It literally says your love is “written in stone” (pardon the pun).
          Of course, we could quote various market research firms that tell you exactly how many women accept a proposal made with a beautiful bridal diamond ring. But that won’t tell you exactly how your special one will react to your proposal .

        <h2 class="heading">Frequently Asked Questions about Engagements Rings:</h2>
        <p>
          <b>1.	How can I check what engagement ring size will suit my fiancée?</b><br>
          You can simply check the right size for your fiancée’s finger band by using a piece of thread or a flossing string. Wind the thread or floss around her ring finger and mark the place where the two ends meet. Now stretch out the thread/floss on a ruler that can help you check the length down to millimeters. You could also borrow her existing promise ring or any other ring that she wears to check the size.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2.	How much should you spend on an engagement ring?</b><br>
          In case you don’t have a budget in mind, you can always decide on it once you shortlist a few favorites by going through our collection online. We cover a wide price range, starting as low as $39.99. So, whatever your budget, you will find just the one that perfectly reflects your commitment right here. Our diamond ring and bridal sets are made with certified stones, so you need never worry about the quality, regardless of the price.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3.	What type of ring is best suited for an engagement?</b><br>
          We love the traditional diamond ring. But, it all depends on what you and your special one prefer. If you want to stand out from the crowd, check out rings in other precious stones, such as sapphires and emeralds, placed exquisitely with finely cut diamonds.
        </p>
        <p><b>4.	When should you give an engagement ring?</b><br>
          Firstly, buy an engagement ring online only when you believe that both of you are ready to take your relationship to the next level. The next step is to decide when to give her the ring. You could consider a romantic dinner, during a moonlit stroll or maybe by recreating your first date. Remember, this is something that the two of you will cherish for a lifetime. So, make it special.
        </p>
        <p><b>5.	What is the starting price for diamond rings?</b><br>
          A diamond ring made of lab-grown diamonds may start as low as $39.99, but the price also depends on various other factors, such as the metal used for the band, the size of the precious gemstone, the brand and the number of stones on the ring.
        </p>
        <p><b>6.	Is a wedding ring worn on the right or left hand?</b><br>
          Different cultures might have different norms about which hand to wear a wedding ring on. In the American culture, and for Christians across the world, the engagement and wedding rings are worn on the ring finger of the left hand.
        </p>
        <p><b>7.	Since the engagement ring is worn on a daily basis, what would you advise for cleaning and care of the ring?</b><br>
          To get the ring to look as good as new for a long time to come, some basic care tips can be followed. Here’s a look:<br>
          1.	Avoid contact with water or sweat as much as possible.<br>
          2.	When removing the ring before bathing or for household chores, ensure that you pull the ring out by the band and not the stone.<br>
          3.	Place tiny dishes around the house, where you can place the ring for safekeeping when you remove it.<br>
          4.	To clean the ring, you can place it in a glass of vodka for an hour and then wipe off the excess liquid gently with a soft, lint-free cloth. Alternatively, place the ring in a bowl of liquid detergent and lukewarm water for 30 minutes and then wipe off gently with a soft, lint-free cloth.<br>
          5.	Don’t place it with other jewelry in a jewelry box, since rubbing against other metals or sharp edges could damage the body.<br>
          6.	Please note that some metals or stones may require special care. Follow the instructions for care given with the ring.
        </p>
        <p><b>8.	Why should I buy engagement rings online from Jewelili?</b><br>

Also, don’t forget to read the frequently asked questions to know the odd namesake’s backstory.<br>

These <a href="/collections/diamond-fashion-bracelets">fashion bracelets</a> come with a slide attachment that allows you to slide both ends of the bracelet together once you slip them on. In terms of style, they excel with their carefree and free-spirited feel.<br>
          4.

        <p><b>5.	How do I determine my bracelet size?</b><br>
          There are bracelet size checker tools available online, or you could do it right at home. Use a very flexible measuring tape to check the part of your forearm's circumference where you usually wear a bracelet. If you don't have a measuring tape available at home, use any ribbon or string and place it around your wrist or arm in the desired area. Mark the circumference and measure that ribbon or string on your toolbox scale to check the inches/cm.

        <h2 class="heading">Diamond Cocktail Rings Should Be a Part of Every Woman’s Jewelry Collection</h2>
        <p>Did you know that cocktail rings emerged as a sign of rebellion during the prohibition era in the United States a century ago? The “Roaring Twenties” saw a huge cultural shift in America. Women stepped out of the home to work and won the right to vote. With this came a change in their attire too, while giving birth to the cocktail ring.<br>
          Worn boldly on the right hand, this was not a wedding ring and often bought by the women themselves. Therefore, they also symbolized independence. Even in the 21st century, diamond cocktail rings are more than just a fashion statement. They are emblems of confidence and the modern woman, breaking the shackles of a hitherto male-dominated society.<br>
          At Jewelili, we see cocktail rings for women as a symbol of empowerment and, therefore, a must-have for every woman. This is why we offer among the widest collections of cocktail rings online, in diamond, gold, silver, and a range of gemstones. When you shop at Jewelili, you know you will only get to buy the highest quality <a href="/collections/diamond-rings">cocktail diamond rings</a> that will complement your personality.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">What is a Cocktail Ring Anyway? </h2>
        <p>The story of women’s empowerment doesn’t end with the 1920s. The cocktail ring is meant to be worn on any finger, except the left hand’s ring finger. It is a jewelry piece that also symbolizes sisterhood and is a gift you either give yourself or your besties. So, when you buy cocktail rings online, you are gifting more than just diamond jewelry.<br>
          Cocktail rings for women generally have a large focal point, embedded with a strikingly large diamond or gemstone encircled by smaller diamonds. The stones come in different shapes, sizes, and colors to help you make a bold statement. Silver cocktail rings feature a large stone in the center, surrounded by diamonds or accent stones.<br>
          Our range of silver and gold cocktail rings is embedded with distinctly cut central gemstones, such as sapphire or amethyst, and surrounded by smaller diamonds. When you buy cocktail rings at Jewelili, you know that you will get the most competitive pricing without compromising the quality or authenticity of the stones.<br>
          So, go ahead and check out our collection and give yourself the symbol of empowerment you deserve.

        <h2 class="heading">Frequently Asked Questions about Diamond Cocktail Rings</h2>
        <p>There is an element of cocktail rings online that is often forgotten. These stylish pieces of <a href="/">diamond jewelry</a> are not chosen as frequently because they require a certain amount of confidence when worn. We, at Jewelili, think differently. This ring style is ideal for adding confidence to your look, rather than requiring confidence to carry them off. They are not just about symbolism but have great aesthetic value as well. In case you still have some questions about buying cocktail rings or how to take care of them, check out this section.</p>
        <p><b>1.	Can you wear a cocktail ring every day?</b><br>
          Cocktail rings are versatile pieces of jewelry so that you can pair them with various types of attire, including everyday office wear. Just make sure that the ring isn’t too large for a formal setup in the office. So, just like cocktail dresses, you take out the bigger ones with more bling for the night. On the other hand, if you have different rings on your fingers, it may be challenging to wear a cocktail ring daily.
        </p>
        <p><b>2.	Can you use a cocktail ring as an engagement ring?</b><br>
          This is an important question a lot of men and women have asked us. A white gold diamond cocktail ring may perhaps be the solution to this odd confusion. As mentioned earlier, these rings are generally not worn on the ring finger and are too heavy for everyday wear. But if the design is slightly more subtle than the average cocktail ring, it could be easily used as an <a href="/collections/diamond-engagement-rings">engagement ring</a>.
        </p>
        <p><b>3.	How do I choose the perfect cocktail ring?</b><br>
          There is no single design or type of cocktail ring that suits everyone. So, first, consider your wardrobe and what you are likely to wear the ring with. You also have to consider the stone that you want in the center. Our cocktail rings for women are versatile and can be worn for almost any occasion - from a get-together brunch with the girls to accessorizing your evening outfit.
        </p>
        <p><b>4.	How do I store my diamond ring?</b><br>
          Every diamond cocktail ring bought at Jewelili comes in an attractive box, which is perfect for storing your ring and helps protect the stones and metal from getting scratches from brushing against other pieces of jewelry. By storing the ring in this box, you can keep it looking as good as new for a long time to come.
        </p>
        <p><b>5.	What is the price of a cocktail ring?</b><br>
          We offer cocktail rings for every type of woman and every type of budget. This is why our collection starts at a mere $7.99. Depending on the stones and the base metal used, the prices will vary. Besides diamonds and crystals, cocktail rings also come with gemstones, such as rubies, emeralds, amethyst, and more.
