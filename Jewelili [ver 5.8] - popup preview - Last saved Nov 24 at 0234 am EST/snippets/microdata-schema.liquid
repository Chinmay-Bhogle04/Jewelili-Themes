        3. Place tiny dishes around the house, where you can place the ring for safekeeping when you remove it.
        4. To clean the ring, you can place it in a glass of vodka for an hour and then wipe off the excess liquid gently with a soft, lint-free cloth. Alternatively, place the ring in a bowl of liquid detergent and lukewarm water for 30 minutes and then wipe off gently with a soft, lint-free cloth.
        5. Don’t place it with other jewelry in a jewelry box, since rubbing against other metals or sharp edges could damage the body.

Rinse well with water and dry with a soft, lint-free cloth, similar to that used for cleaning your spectacles. We recommend that you do not clean it too often and store it carefully when not in use. Better still, take it to a retailer near you or write to us. We’ll polish the bracelet to upgrade the look to as good as new."
